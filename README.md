# Porth

Video tutorial series by youtube channel Tsoding Daily

Paraphrasing Tsoding: 
It's like Forth but in Python. But I don't know Forth. Some sort of stack-based programming language.

## Tutorial 1, up and running

Folder stage001_python-asm:

"Making Programming Language in Python — Porth Ep.01"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QP2fDBIxjM

## Quick Start
```console
  ./porth.py sim
  ./porth.py com
  ./output
```
Examples:
 
```console
  ./porth.py com ./examples/test.porth
  ./porth.py sim ./examples/test.porth
```

Tutorial will be commited in stages where the language is redesigned to keep track of old things that might still be interesting.

## Tutorial 2, simple lexer 

Folder stage002_simple_lexer

Error reporting now works, a simple implemented lexer and some extra C and Python code to look at. Plus a faulty porth example for testing error reporting.
