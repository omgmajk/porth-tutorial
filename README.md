# Porth

Paraphrasing Tsoding: 
It's like Forth but in Python. But I don't know Forth. Some sort of stack-based programming language.

## Quick Start
```console
  ./porth.py sim
  ./porth.py com
  ./output
```
Examples:
 
```console
  ./porth.py com ./examples/test.porth
```


Tutorial will be commited in stages where the language is redesigned to keep track of old things that might still be interesting.
